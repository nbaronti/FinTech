# FinTech Interests

My name is Nick Baronti.  I am a finance profressional and CPA.  I currently work for Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) as a real estate strategy consultant.

My career goals moving forward are to advance my skills in FinTech and take on a more technical role in a growing tech organization.

I have a growing passion for exploring new technologies and learning how to advance my skillset in the intersecting fields of Finance & Tech.  I hope to grow my technical skills in programming, data analysis, blockchain, and AI & machine learning and integrate these skills with my finance background.
