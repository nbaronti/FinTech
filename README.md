# FinTech Interests

My name is Nick Baronti.  I am a finance profressional and CPA.  I currently work for JLL as a real estate strategy consultant.

My career goals are to advance my skills in FinTech and take on a more technical role in a growing tech organization.

I have a growing passion for exploring new technologies and learning how to advance my skillset in the field of Finance.  I hope to grow my technical skills in programming, data analysis, and AI & machine learning and level up my skills in my finance background.

I would also like to learn more about blockchain and its applications within finance.
